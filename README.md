# PyBer Analysis Challenge
## Overview of the Project
V. Isualize from PyBer has asked to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. The following are to be included:
1. Create a summary DataFame including Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver.
2. Create a Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data_challenge.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib

## Summary of Results
### Summary DataFrame
Looking at city type, the total rides, total drivers and total fares is greatest in urban cities and least in rural cities.  However, the average fare per ride is greatest in rural cities at $34.62, with suburban cities at $30.97, but for urban cities is only $24.53. Also, because the number of drivers is so large in urban cities, the average fare per driver is much lower ($16.57) than in rural cities ($55.49).

### Multi-Line Plot
Looking at the sum of the fares by city type over time, we can see that the total fares in urban cities is much greater than in either suburban or rural cities.
- The line plot for urban cities often shows an average fare more than four times that of the rural cities, sometimes five times greater.
- Both the suburban and rural cities saw a peak in total fares at the end of February.
- The highest sum for rural cities was in early April 2019.
- The highest sum for suburban and urban cities was at the end of February 2019.
- Suburban fares seemed to increase through January but then taper off until the last week in February.
- Urban fares increased through the end of February and then became intermittent through March.
